# Fundamental Data Structures, Algorithms and solutions to problems
My implementions of some of the most important Data Structures and Algorithms in Computer Science and solutions to problems from **Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis by Mark Allen Weiss**.

The implementions and solutions are barely optimal since they were written during my own journey of learning DSA and C++. However, they will serve as a good enough reference to anyone learning DSA(especially if using the M.A Weiss book) as the standard library source code is too cryptic and geekforgeeks is too bad at times.
